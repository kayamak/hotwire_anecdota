# TAILWIND RAILS

The objective of this project is to learn and document how to use Tailwind.

1. Go through the components in Tailwind UI and implement them with HTML/ERB
2. For JavaScript, create Stimulus controllers that can be used with the Tailwind UI components.
3. Explore how we can use Turbo/Hotwire to further augment these components
